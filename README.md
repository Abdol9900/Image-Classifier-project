# Image Classifier Project for Flower Species Using PyTorch

##### This project is a part of the data scientist nano-degree program in Udacity. This project aims to train a neural network on images dataset Then use the trained model to classify a new image after testing the model classifier.

### Python 3 should be used to run the project also there are some packages should be download to implement the image classifier:
1- PyTorch

2-torchvision

3-numpy 

4-pandas 

5-matplotlib
